You're my drug
You know that I'm addicted
Lights are off
The games you play are wicked
And you say
I steal your heart, I steal your heart
But you take it from the day I know you
And now I'm singin'

U au au
I'm so helpless, I'm so reckless
Singin' u au au
Feels like I love you
Feels like I don't know you at all
Feels like I don't know you at all

I'm in love
I always knew I would be
So in lust
Your perfect body drew me
And you say
I steal your heart, I steal your heart
But you take it from the day I know you
And now I'm singin'

U au au
I'm so helpless, I'm so reckless
Singin' au au
Feels like I love you
Feels like I don't know you at all
